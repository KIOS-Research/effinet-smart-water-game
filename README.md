# effinet-smart-water-game
A python-based game which runs on Raspberry Pi, for promoting the Effinet FP7 Project (http://effinet.eu/)

# The Smart Water Networks Game
More than 100 students have had the opportunity to learn about the future of water distribution management and the key objectives of EFFINET-FP7 project, through an interactive game specially designed for students aged 10-17, which was presented as part of the event “Through the researchers’ eyes” organized by the Research Promotion Foundation of Cyprus in Nisocia on Friday 28 November 2014. The objective of the event was to bring public and researchers together, and instigate interest in
research and science.

For this event, EFFINET researchers designed an interactive Question/Answer game which runs on a low-cost computational device (Raspberry Pi), which is widely used for education purposes. The questions served as a basis to address various key issues related to water issues, such as: how much water do Europeans consume daily, which substances can be used to disinfect water, what is the leakage percentage with respect to water consumption, how much energy is used for water distribution, how are leakages detected as well as how can we reduce the energy costs in water distribution systems. After each question, a flashcard appeared providing more details and explanations, along with some references.

The game platform is released under an open-source license and is available to be downloaded, translated and edited at https://github.com/KIOS-Research/effinet-smart-water-game.

# How to run
- Install Python 3
- Open a Command-line window `cmd` and open the download folder
